Explore the fascinating realm of retail analysis with our latest project on Kaggle! I've dived deep into [customer shopping trends using SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andywow/customer-shopping-trends-analysis), uncovering valuable insights into purchase behavior, subscription trends, payment preferences, and more. You can download the pdf version [here](http://dandywibowo.github.io/files/customeranalysis.pdf).

The dataset includes the following key characteristics:

Customer demographics: Age, Gender Purchase details: Item purchased, purchase amount, category, location, season Customer Behavior: Review ratings, subscription status, payment methods Transaction History: Previous purchases, purchase frequency Other relevant attributes: Size, color, shipping type, discounts applied, promo codes used

Our goal with this data set is to perform in-depth analysis to understand customer preferences, identify key drivers of purchase behavior, and provide companies with valuable insights for strategic decision-making and marketing initiatives.
