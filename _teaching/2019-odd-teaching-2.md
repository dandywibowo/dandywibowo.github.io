During my Bachelor's studies, I gained valuable teaching experience as a teaching assistant for [a Distributed Information Systems Lab course]([url](https://pddikti.kemdikbud.go.id/data_dosen/C77F4B7A-BE0B-4833-930A-33A111D1D744/8B06CF58-F8F7-4BA6-B582-750F723C86B8)). I had the privilege of working alongside [Dr. Ahmad Abdul Chamid]([url](https://ti.umk.ac.id/)), a Lecturer at Muria Kudus University. I had the responsibility to teach in one class where the course size was approximately 30 students.

Subjects Covered:
======
**Distributed Databases:** Understanding the architecture and management of data across multiple locations.
**Remote Procedure Calls (RPC):** Exploring mechanisms for invoking procedures on remote machines transparently.
**Distributed File Systems:** Learning how to access and manage files stored on geographically dispersed systems.
**Naming and Directory Services:** Discovering techniques for locating resources within a distributed network.
**Concurrency Control and Replication:** Mastering strategies for ensuring data consistency and availability in concurrent and replicated environments.

My Role:
======
In this role, I actively supported Dr. Chamid in delivering the course content. My responsibilities included:

**Assisting with Lab Sessions:** Facilitating lab exercises, guiding students through practical applications of the theoretical concepts, and troubleshooting technical difficulties.
**Providing Individualized Support:** Offering personalized guidance and answering student questions during lab sessions and office hours.
**Grading Assignments:** Evaluating student work and providing constructive feedback to enhance their understanding.

Mentorship and Collaboration:
======
Dr. Chamid provided invaluable mentorship throughout this experience. His consistent support, encouragement, and expertise in distributed systems were truly inspiring. We have collaborated effectively for over four years, initially as student and instructor, and now as colleagues passionate about computer science education.
